# About Me

I am a software engineer at Disney working on shared event schemas, tooling, and
data streaming for teams building Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN.

I spend most of my hobbyist coding time writing Scala, Python, and Lua.  But I often
like to dip my toes into random new tools and languages.

When I'm not programming, I love watching movies and TV with my wife and two dogs,
learning tracks with my racing sim, and reading science fiction.
