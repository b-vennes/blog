# Building A Blog With Scala Mdoc And Docusaurus

This is a blog post showing how I set up this blog using SBT, Mdoc, and Docusaurus.

It wasn't too complex of a task, but it helped me to have some pre-existing knowledge of all the tools.

If you aren't familiar with SBT, or even Scala, I would recommend trying out a basic Scala project first before diving in here.

SBT is a modular and extensible build tool, designed for compiling JVM projects (Scala specifically), but suitable for just about any project.
